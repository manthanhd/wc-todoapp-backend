# wc-todoapp-backend
Backend app as seen on my Youtube Writing Code series

## Prerequisites
You must have the following software installed before you can use this code:
1. git
2. node
3. npm

## How to

### 1. Clone the repository
If you are doing this for the first time, clone the repository using the following command (you must have git, node and npm preinstalled):
```sh
git clone https://github.com/manthanhd/wc-todoapp-backend.git
```

### 2. Update the repository
If you have just cloned the repository fresh, you may not need to do this. If have already cloned it but can't find the code for the latest session, run the following command:
```sh
git fetch origin
```

### 3. Checkout the branch for a session
Each session is uploaded to its own branch. In order to "checkout" the code, run the following command:
```sh
git checkout <branch-name>
```

For example, to checkout the [first session](#project-setup), run:
```sh
git checkout session-1-project-setup
```

If for some reason the checkout fails, try [updating the repository (step 2)](#2-update-the-repository), check for typos in branch name and/or try again.

Remember, you can always browse code on github.com using the **code link** under the session.
